Scheduling system for Elizabeth House Food Pantry.  This app will allow volunteers to log in and create appointments for clients.  Other volunteers will log in and check clients in.  Reports will be generated and mailed monthly, quarterly and yearly.

## Development

Install Postgres using [Postgres.app](https://github.com/PostgresApp/PostgresApp/releases/download/v2.0.3/Postgres-2.0.3.dmg) and run it to get your database up and running.

We're using Ruby 2.4.1. If you don't yet have a method for installing/managing Ruby versions [jgaskins](https://github.com/jgaskins) recommends [RVM](https://rvm.io).

With RVM installed, type

    $ rvm use 2.4.1

If you don't have Ruby 2.4.1 installed, RVM will give you instructions for installing it (after which you should retry the above command).

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/rubyforgood/pantry_scheduler.git && cd pantry_scheduler

Install the gems:

    $ bundle install

Create and migrate your development database:

    $ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

Install node and yarn

    $ brew install node yarn
